Building and installation instructions
--------------------------------------

Before proceed to the compilation of grkbd make sure that you have development
tools (C compiler, linker and make utility). In debian based distributions
these can be found in the "build-essential" package.
To check if you have these tools installed you can type "gcc" at your shell
prompt and see the response. If the output is "no input files" you have them.
If the answer is "command not found" you have to install them.

Also, you have to make sure that you have the X11 header files in your system.
You can find the header files in the package "xlibs-dev". To check wether you
have the header files or not, you can search for the file Xlib.h in you file
system (normally, it will be under /usr/include).

After finishing with the prerequisities you can go ahead with the installation.
Presumably, you have already untared the tarball and jumped into the created
folder. At this point, you may need to edit the Makefile and change CFLAGS to
specify any additional directories for header files and libraries. After that,
you can go ahead and run:

# make

If the program compiles without errors, you can optionally install it in your
system for it to be available for all users. To do so type:

# sudo make install

This will install grkbd in your /usr/local/bin directory.
